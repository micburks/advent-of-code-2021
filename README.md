# advent of code 2021

I decided to do AOC this year to get back into the problem solving mindset.
Types may have helped in a couple problems but were useless in most places so
I went JS. I also fumbled through SQL and Rust in the first couple days. After
Day 18, the time investment became more than I was getting out of it so I quit.

I would do this again next year. I think it was nice to get back to solving
algorithms even though I don't approach them with mathematical solutions.
I especially liked using these to get a better understanding of SQL.
